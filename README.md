    Identify factors affecting sales and customer retention.
    Provide actionable recommendations (e.g., targeted marketing strategies, loyalty programs).

   ## Findings
   Customer Demographics & Preferences:

    The dataset includes 30,000 customer records with attributes like name, gender, age, profession, and location.
    Customers belong to various professions, including health therapists, political scientists, and statisticians.
    A variety of favorite colors are recorded, which may be useful for targeted marketing strategies.

Spending Patterns:

    The "price(CAD)" column indicates purchase amounts, with values ranging from small to large purchases.
    Analyzing spending habits based on demographics (e.g., age groups, profession) could reveal valuable insights into customer segments.

Transaction & Payment Insights:

    Customers use different credit card types (Visa, Maestro, Diners Club, etc.).
    The credit card expiration dates vary, which may help in predicting future payment risks.
    Purchases are recorded on different days of the week and times (AM/PM), which can help identify peak shopping periods.
